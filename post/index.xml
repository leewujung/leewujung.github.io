      <description>As nerve-racking as it is to count down on the time to finish my talk, I am super excited for the joint ASA/CAA meeting next week in Victoria, BC. In addition to giving a talk on mining large echosounder data sets, I will be co-chairing a special session 2aAO+2pAO: Machine Learning and Data Science Approaches in Ocean Acoustics on Tuesday. The session is co-sponsored by multiple technical committees and follows immediately from the more general 1aSP+1pSP: Machine Learning for Acoustic Applications on Monday.</description>

      <description>This is something I wrote in 2017 right after coming back from my first trip with the OOI cabled array team. Didn&amp;rsquo;t have the website up then and things got busy, so I forgot about it&amp;hellip; üò±
On VISIONS&amp;rsquo;18, now seems about the time to dust this off. The echogram from the echosounder still looks awesome after a year, so read on! üòé
Watching a solar eclipse is a powerful experience for most people, and that is no exception for those of us who sailed on R/V Roger Revelle during the VISIONS‚Äô17 expedition - the annual service cruise to maintain the hundreds of instruments installed on the Cabled Array of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) network.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: this is a duplication of this on the VISIONS&amp;rsquo;18 website.
This is my second time sailing with the OOI Cabled Array team from UW APL and the School of Oceanography, with a mission to scoop up some zooplankton from the ocean. These zooplankton samples will serve as verification data &amp;ndash; or ‚Äúground truth‚Äù &amp;ndash; for the cabled Bio-acoustic Sonars (ZPLSC-B) on the OOI Endurance Array. On Leg 4 of VISIONS&amp;rsquo;18, we only had time to visit the Oregon offshore cabled site, so that&amp;rsquo;s where we towed.</description>
