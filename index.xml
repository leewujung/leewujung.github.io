      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is something I wrote in 2017 right after coming back from my first trip with the OOI cabled array team. Didn&amp;rsquo;t have the website up then and things got busy, so I forgot about it&amp;hellip; 😱&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On VISIONS&amp;rsquo;18, now seems about the time to dust this off. The echogram from the echosounder still looks awesome after a year, so read on! 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching a solar eclipse is a powerful experience for most people, and that is no exception for those of us who sailed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Roger_Revelle_(AGOR-24)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R/V Roger Revelle&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Roger_Revelle_(AGOR-24)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VISIONS’17&lt;/a&gt; expedition - the annual service cruise to maintain the hundreds of instruments installed on the Cabled Array of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI)&lt;/a&gt; network. This year, the eclipse came as we steamed offshore from Newport, OR to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Axial Seamount&lt;/a&gt; in the beginning of the third leg of this cruise. However, that morning, the sun was nowhere in sight, as our patch of the sky was completely covered with clouds. But even then, we still experienced the sudden changes of ambient light and the short period of &amp;ldquo;night&amp;rdquo; on deck as the moon passed in front of the sun. And we wondered, do the animals in the ocean feel the same difference, and if so, how would they respond?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that scientists have been asking these questions as early as at least the 1950s. Similar to well-known eclipse-associated behavioral changes of terrestrial animals, scientists have found out that many marine organisms respond to the rapid change of light level in a similar way as they respond to the regular cycles of day and night. In regular days, many marine animals ascend from the deep to near the surface around dusk and descend back around dawn, in a behavior dubbed the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;diel vertical migration (DVM)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;. This is the greatest movement of biomass on earth, happening everyday across the globe ocean. During a solar eclipse, interestingly, many animals respond in similar ways, swimming upward as the light intensity drops temporarily during the time when the moon moves in front of the sun. Other changes, such as significant increases in bioluminescence, have also been recorded. On R/V Roger Revelle, even though we did not carry the type of instruments that would allow us to make the same type of direct observation, we knew that the almost real-time stream of data from the OOI cabled nodes would be perfect for this purpose - especially when &lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org/2017/08/august-21-eclipse-related-data-from-the-endurance-array/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;several of them are located right within or next to the path of maximum totality&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://leewujung.github.io/img/blog_img/2018-07-30-eclipse-2017/DVM_illustration.png&#34; width=&#34;500px&#34; /&gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;The moored echosounder on the OOI network can help us observe the vertical movements of zooplankton by measuring their echoes.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I therefore went straight to the OOI data archive to download data collected by the echosounder deployed on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org/site/ce04osps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oregon Offshore Cabled Shallow Profiler Mooring&lt;/a&gt; for the day of the eclipse and the following day (August 21-22). Echosounders are sonar systems that are widely used to monitor the location and abundance of animals in the ocean. They can be installed on the bottom of the ship pointing downward, or, as in the case of the OOI, &lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Endurance_OR_2016_09_07_ver_4-01.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;deployed on the seafloor or moorings and pointing upward&lt;/a&gt;. By aligning the returning echoes with appropriate two-way travel delay in the same way as you could measure your distance from a cliff by clapping and listening to the echo delay, we can &amp;ldquo;see&amp;rdquo; - through sound - where animals are in the water column. To get a sense of light intensity variation, I found corresponding records of solar radiation from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Data Buoy Center&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=46098&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;a super closeby surface buoy&lt;/a&gt; that is also maintained by the OOI team. Here, the data were collected by a pyranometer, which measures the combination of direct and diffuse solar radiation in the 400-1100 nm range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://leewujung.github.io/img/blog_img/2018-07-30-eclipse-2017/rad_echo_20170821.png&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; /&gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Solar radiation (top) and echosounder data (bottom) recorded on August 21, the day of the eclipse. The “dip” around 10:15 AM shows the dramatic change of solar radiation level during the time of eclipse. This drop of light intensity induced a “spike” in the echosounder observation due to the brief upward movement of many animals in the ocean.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash;NOTE&amp;ndash;&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leewujung/echopype/blob/master/notebooks/zpls_data_example.ipynb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the notebook I used to create this figure directly from data downloaded from the OOI &lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org/data/raw-data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Raw Data Archive&lt;/a&gt;. The notebook included some info about echosounder data processing as well. I am going to dust off this package and the notebook this month during the &lt;a href=&#34;https://oceanhackweek.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oceanhackweek&lt;/a&gt;, and will post an update then!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking the &amp;ldquo;echograms,&amp;rdquo; or sonar images of the water column, compiled from data collected by the 200 kHz echosounder on the cabled mooring during August 21, 2017, I saw just what had been reported in many other eclipses: a large number of animals on their way down to the deep as part of the regular DVM cycle briefly swam upward as the sun dimmed, and continued to descend as soon as the sun was back to its full glare! It is fascinating to see that the variation we saw is almost identical to &lt;a href=&#34;http://ac.els-cdn.com/0011747175900637/1-s2.0-0011747175900637-main.pdf?_tid=2deda4ec-8918-11e7-8512-00000aacb35e&amp;amp;acdnat=1503612448_03cf380f3033ed8adbdb83547482edb8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;those observed on Cape Verde Islands back in 1973&lt;/a&gt;, using a similar sonar system. Also, the long-term observatory nature of the OOI infrastructure made it super easy to compare animal movement patterns across multiple days at exactly the same location, without confounding factors such as ship movements as in previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the awe we experienced during this solar eclipse, the fact that I could just download the relevant data sets and observe marine organism responses in almost real-time was an excellent demonstration of the power of the ocean observatory network: anyone from anywhere, if interested, can join in at any time to take a look at a corner of the vast ocean and discover something exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big thanks to all the people who have worked through days and nights over these past 10 years to make this possible, and of course to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;National Science Foundation&lt;/a&gt; for supporting this endeavor!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scooping up zooplankton from the ocean</title>
      <link>https://leewujung.github.io/2018/07/27/scooping-up-zooplankton-from-the-ocean/</link>

      <guid>https://leewujung.github.io/2018/07/27/scooping-up-zooplankton-from-the-ocean/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is a duplication of &lt;a href=&#34;https://interactiveoceans.washington.edu/story/Scooping_Up_Zooplankton_From_The_Ocean&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; on the VISIONS&amp;rsquo;18 website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my second time sailing with the OOI &lt;a href=&#34;https://interactiveoceans.washington.edu/story/The_Regional_Cabled_Array&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cabled Array&lt;/a&gt; team from UW APL and the School of Oceanography, with a mission to scoop up some zooplankton from the ocean. These zooplankton samples will serve as verification data &amp;ndash; or “ground truth” &amp;ndash; for the cabled Bio-acoustic Sonars (&lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org/instrument-series/zplscb/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ZPLSC-B&lt;/a&gt;) on the OOI Endurance Array. On Leg 4 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://interactiveoceans.washington.edu/story/VISIONS_18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;VISIONS&amp;rsquo;18&lt;/a&gt;, we only had time to visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://oceanobservatories.org/site/ce04osps/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Oregon offshore cabled site&lt;/a&gt;, so that&amp;rsquo;s where we towed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Sonar was originally [an acronym]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar)) for &#34;**SO**und **N**avigation **A**nd **R**anging&#34;, but nowadays this term is widely understood since sonar systems are everywhere in our lives, like those sensors on cars that remind us when a wall, a pole, or a car is coming too close. It&#39;s a form a remote sensing, in which we send out probing signals and analyze the returning echoes to observe and understand the environment. Since it is remote, most of the time we don&#39;t know exactly what is producing the echoes, and hence the need for *ground truth* using real samples --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboard &lt;a href=&#34;https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ships/revelle&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R/V Revelle&lt;/a&gt;, we use a &lt;a href=&#34;http://openseas.com/portfolio/tucker-trawl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tucker trawl&lt;/a&gt; to collect zooplankton samples from the ocean. It is an entirely mechanical net system, consisting of 4 horizontal metal bars and 2 vertical flexible wires that jointly function as the frame for net openings, and 3 nets with cod-ends attached. Below was the net right before it went into water:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://leewujung.github.io/img/blog_img/2018-07-26-scoop-zoop/NetTow_20180723_144502.JPG&#34; width=&#34;550px&#34; /&gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Tucker trawl right before it went into water. Note the flowmeter we attached to the middle of the net.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The operation of Tucker trawl is quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You hook all 3 nets to the metal bars and lower the net into water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the net is at the first target depth, you send a &lt;em&gt;messenger&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; which is heavy metal block &amp;ndash; down the wire to drop the first bar. This bar closes the bottom net and opens up the middle net&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the net is at the next target depth, you send another messenger down to drop the second bar. This bar closes the middle net and open up the top net; usually this is also the time to start pulling the net back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the net is back on deck, you rinse down everything in the net to the cod-end and preserve the samples in jars filled with formalin or alcohol.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tucker trawl is nice, because the messengers and the dropping bars give you the flexibility to do &lt;em&gt;depth-stratified sampling&lt;/em&gt; of the water column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much how it went, just every step took a bit of time to complete, and it&amp;rsquo;s definitely NOT a one-person job!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://leewujung.github.io/img/blog_img/2018-07-26-scoop-zoop/NetTow_20180723_141404.JPG&#34; width=&#34;550px&#34; /&gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;It takes many hands to put the Tucker trawl together.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onboard Revelle, I tapped into the raw beam data of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_Doppler_current_profiler&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ADCP&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;coustic &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;oppler &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;urrent &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rofiler) to get a sense of where things are in the water column for the tow. Thanks to Skip who suggested this when I freaked out last year after finding out there was no echosounder to tell me where the critters would be in the water column. It works very well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the figure below I plotted the ADCP &lt;em&gt;raw beam&lt;/em&gt; returns during the first tow on July 21, 2018 along with the time-depth trajectory of the net. On the echogram, the brighter regions are where most of the animals concentrated. You can see that our tow was right up against the time when the diel vertical migration (DVM) happened. This increased the variability in the samples quite a bit, since different animals are somewhat lumped together during DVM and during the night, but at least we got something!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://leewujung.github.io/img/blog_img/2018-07-26-scoop-zoop/2018-07-21-adcp-tow.png&#34; width=&#34;550px&#34; /&gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Tucker trawl trajectory on the 2018-07-21 tow. The background is an &amp;ldquo;echogram&amp;rdquo; assembled by compiling the amplitude of echo returns from the ship ADCP. The rain drop-like features on the echogram are interference from other acoustic instruments operating at the same time. The white net trajectory here was obtained by a time-depth recorder that was attached to the net.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;** To see how this plot was generated, check my work-in-progress &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/leewujung/adcp2Sv/blob/master/RR1812_net_tow_20180721.ipynb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;notebook&lt;/a&gt; that hopefully will get updated in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The net trajectory seems quite nice, except for that the second messenger didn&amp;rsquo;t successfully trigger! So we ended up with a nice sampling of the top layer from the bottom net, everything else in the middle net, and pretty much nothing from the top net (which didn&amp;rsquo;t open). Nevertheless, from the samples, it seemed that the deeper layer was dominated by adult krill and the surface layer had more juveniles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second time around on July 23, 2018, we fixed the trigger mechanism and the tow was nicely stratified, but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a 2-layer structure&amp;hellip;! even though we were at very similar location as the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, we did scoop up quite a bit of animals from the two tows! We have lots of juvenile and adult krill, lots of copepods, lots of amphipods, and some ctenophores, jellyfish, and all kinds of fish larvae. All the samples are now submerged in formalin-filled jars waiting to be analyzed in more detail once we get back to shore. I am excited to check out the OOI Bio-acoustic Sonar recording during the time of the tows and learn more about the ecosystem here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to make up for the lack of bizarre-looking animals in the catches this year, here&amp;rsquo;s a hyperiid amphipod (genus &lt;a href=&#34;https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/invertebrates/cystisoma&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cystisoma&lt;/a&gt;) that ended up in our net last year. Note the diameter of the white cap underneath is 11cm. This thing was huge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;https://leewujung.github.io/img/blog_img/2018-07-26-scoop-zoop/IMG_3483.JPG&#34; width=&#34;550px&#34; /&gt;



&lt;figcaption data-pre=&#34;Figure &#34; data-post=&#34;:&#34; &gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;A hyperiid amphipod we caught in 2017.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
